## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing HR data to gain valuable insights into employee performance, satisfaction, and retention. The dataset consists of five key Excel sheets: **EducationLevel**, **Employee**, **PerformanceRating**, **RatingLevel**, and **SatisfiedLevel**. Power BI was used for data extraction, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization, providing a comprehensive view of the HR data.

The analysis aims to uncover key trends and relationships in employee performance, satisfaction, and education, offering actionable insights for HR decision-making.

## Data Description

The project utilizes the following dataset:

1. **EducationLevel**: Information on the education level of employees, including degree types and classifications.
2. **Employee**: Contains personal and demographic data for each employee, such as age, department, job role, and hire date.
3. **PerformanceRating**: Employee performance ratings, evaluating their productivity and job performance.
4. **RatingLevel**: Categorized levels of performance ratings, such as "Unacceptable", "Exceeds Expectations", etc.
5. **SatisfiedLevel**: Employee satisfaction levels.

The data is processed and analyzed to create valuable reports that can guide HR strategies, including performance improvement, employee retention, and talent development.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: The project uses Power BI to extract data from five distinct Excel sheets to create a unified dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning was performed, including handling missing values, normalization, and transforming the data into usable formats for analysis.
- **Data Modeling**: The project incorporates multiple relationships and data models to link the various tables, ensuring accurate and meaningful analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive reports and dashboards were created in Power BI to visualize insights on employee performance, satisfaction, and education levels. Key questions explored include:
  - What are the performance trends across different education levels?
  - Satisfaction levels across various departments?
  - How do satisfaction levels correlate with performance ratings?
